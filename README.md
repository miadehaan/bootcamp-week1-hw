Homework 1
# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

For homework 1, I cleaned up the existing code and utilized semantic elements. I replaced all the <div> tags with more meaningful elements such as: <main>, <section>, <aside>, etc. I made sure that all of the images had alt tags. I added some comments for each section to make the code more clear and descriptive about which section it was targetting. I consolidated a lot of the css code becuase some of it was redundant, as well as removed some of the class tags in the html that were redundant and just made the code more difficult to read. I re-ordered the css code to more logically to match the sections in the html. Lastly, I made sure that the webpage still looked the same as the original version, and made sure that all click-able links worked.
